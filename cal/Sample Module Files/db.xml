				<!-- The following tag is optional. it is used to define a tag which identifies the function that will be used to calculate the day of the week given any Year, Month, Day.  This is primarily used to ensure that the calendar wraps days of the week properly for calendars with varying month lengths.  For example, if Jan 31 ends on a Wed, then Feb 1 should fall on a Thurs.  Without a function defined, the first day of the month will always fall on the first day of the week.  If your calendar also has leap years, you must ensure that the leap years are accounted for in the code.  The function that will perform this calculation must be defined in LUA code and located in an extension.  -->
